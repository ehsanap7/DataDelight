Introduction

Hello and welcome to a journey through the intricate world of stock market predictions! ðŸ“ˆ

In this project, we traverse the nuanced landscape of financial data and machine learning techniques to predict stock market trends. Inspired by a vast array of research, ranging from sophisticated predictive models (Sedighi et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019) to the timeless Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) by Fama (1970), this project aims to explore what's possible and where the limits lie.

Why This Project Matters

Financial markets are complex, and predicting their behavior is one of the most challenging tasks in financial research (Chen & Hao, 2017). Many have tried and claimed success (Armano et al., 2005; Atsalakis & Valavanis, 2009a; Weng et al., 2017), but the debate is far from settled.

In the world of EMH, consistent profits from trading shouldn't even be possible. This project is an exploration and a challenge: can machine learning prove or disprove theories like EMH?

What's Inside?

Here's what you'll find in this GitHub repository:

Data Sources: A collection of cleaned, ready-to-use financial datasets.
Machine Learning Models: Python scripts featuring various machine learning algorithms trained on our financial data.
Literature Review: A comprehensive review that tells the tale of stock market prediction through the years, touching on key theories and research milestones.

Future Directions

We're not stopping here. As research progresses and new machine learning techniques become available, so will the sophistication of our models.
